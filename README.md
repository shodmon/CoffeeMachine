# CoffeeMachine
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. It also collects the money which you can then take from cash register.

Stage 1 was: setting up application.
Stage 2 was: program that calculates the amount of ingredients needed to make a certain amount of coffee.
Stage 3: program that calculates whether it will be able to make the required amount of coffee from the specified amount of ingredients.
Stage 4: program that offers to buy one cup of coffee, to fill up the ingredients, or to take its money. At the same time, the program calculates how many ingredients it has left. And also displays the number of ingredients before and after purchase.
Stage 5: program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given.
